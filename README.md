# Fire-detection-and-altering-sytem-UsingIOT


Internet of Things (IoT) is basically a network which consists of physical systems that are embedded with sensors connected to a cloud where data is exchanged with the help of a gateway, which facilitates to and from communication of data connected over the internet. 

Fire detection systems are designed to get fires early within the development once time can still be obtainable for the safe evacuation of occupants. Early detection conjointly plays a major role in protective of safety of emergency response personnel. Property loss will be decreased and period for the operation decreased through early detection as a result of management efforts are started whereas the fireplace remains small.

At the present the appliance of IoT primarily based systems is extended to real time detection and warning system. However, price has been a significant issue for development and implementation of IoT systems. Considering the price, simple implementation, the planned system proposes an occasional cost nevertheless economical IoT system for warning and alerting hearth incidents.

The proposed system has sensors which collects data from the physical world and is continuously sent to the cloud platform. When the temperature increases the preset threshold, the http webhook will be triggered and the notification is sent to the fire department. The amount of equipment to be taken by the fire departments can be moderated with the help of the displayed number of people in the affected area which has been added to the proposed system. 


****Our main aim is to control the fire as soon as possible.****

• The sensors (Infra-red and Temperature) will gather the data from physical word. 

• The data gathered is sent to the cloud platform (ThingSpeak) continuously. 

• When the temperature increases more than the present threshold value, the http 
webhook will be triggered. 

A notification will be sent to the fire department and the number of people in the separate 
areas(rooms) in the affected area(building) will be displayed in the LCD
